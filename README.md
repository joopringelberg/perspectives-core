perspectives-distributed-runtime
======================

### About
The Perspectives Distributed Runtime (PDR) is part of the software created in the course of the [Perspectives Project](https://academy.perspect.it).

The PDR interprets models written in the Perspectives Language. **Patterns of co-operation** can easily be expressed in PL. Examples of co-operation are: buying and selling, renting stuff, a formal meeting, etc.

The PDR has an API for client programs that offer end users screens to interact with each other. Users of such programs exchange information directly, in a Peer-to-Peer fashion, without intermediate servers that store their information.

### Getting started
The PDR is work in progress. It is not yet in a state that it can be used. Hence, we provide no instructions on how to use it right now. However, [here](./technical%20readme.md) is a page with instructions for developers of the PDR.

### Contributing
The PDR is being intensively developed by the core team. We appreciate feedback on the code you can find in this repository
