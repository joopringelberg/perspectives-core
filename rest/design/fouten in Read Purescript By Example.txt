1. Still not clear? Let’s specialize further to the case where m is the V Errors applicative functor above.
	'm' should be 'f'

2. The type signature for Traversable’s other function sequence might look more familiar:

	sequence :: forall a f. Applicative m => t (f a) -> f (t a)
	
	'm' should be 'f'.

1. If m is a law-abiding member of the Monad type class, then there is a valid Applicative instance for apply is given by ap.

	'for apply is given by ap' should probably be 'for apply given by ap'.
