-- | A perspective is serialised for a given context instance, for a particular role.
-- | It contains all instances of that role.
-- | The serialisation is for a given (nested) state of the context and each of its

-- | and actions.
-- Implementation note: these structures are serialised to a JSON string with writeJSON.
