-- | This module defines two `Producer`s (see Control.Coroutine):
-- |
-- | *  of descriptions of a change (`CouchdbChange`)
-- | *  of documents that have changed
-- |
-- | of changes to a Couchdb database.
-- | The changes feed produced by Couchdb is the source of changes.
-- | The individual results are created by decoding the foreign results and can be
-- | either a list of multiple errors, or a `CouchdbChange` or a document
-- | (the type of which needs to be an instance of Decode).
-- | Construct a Producer with an EventSource object created with `createEventSource`.
