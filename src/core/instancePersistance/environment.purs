-- | Conceptually, an `Environment a` is a stack of frames of a, where a is a Foreign.Object.
-- | A variable binding is added to the frame at the top of the stack.
-- | A variable is searched from the top of the stack to the bottom. The value found in the
-- | first frame with the variable name is returned.
-- | This causes variable shadowing.
