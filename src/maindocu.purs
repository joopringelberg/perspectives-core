-- | These documents are documentation generated from the source files of the Perspectives Distributed Runtime.
-- | The documentation system generates documents for all dependencies, including third-party dependencies.
-- |
-- | This results in a discouraging long list of pages. Hence we've included a number of 'modules' that have just some
-- | documentation in them, to point you the way through the main structure of the source files.
-- |
-- | Modules making up the functionality of the Perspectives Distributed Runtime can be categorised in
-- | several groups:
-- | * [representation of types](Perspectives.Docu.TypeRepresentation.html#t:x)
-- | * [persistence of types](Perspectives.Docu.TypePersistence.html#t:x)
-- | * [typechecking](Perspectives.Checking.PerspectivesTypeChecker.html#t:x)
